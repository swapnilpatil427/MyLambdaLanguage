# MyLambdaLanguage
My Lamdba Function Implementation using Haskell.

In this i have implemented my own lambda function language.
Kindly, check the examples folder for the type of code this parser can solve.

Program flow - 
Sample code -> Parser -> Evaluation

Parser - Creates the AST of all the tokens in the sample code.
Evaluation - Calculates the result according to the AST.

TO run this, 
1) Install Haskell
2) Run the Main.hs (it will parse all the examples files and executes them).
